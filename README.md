Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

What Will I Learn After Stage 1?
You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write

To insert the API key, go to the strings.xml file in the res directory and insert your API key in the api_key variable.
